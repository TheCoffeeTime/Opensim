To upload them, you will need the Imprudence Viewer, which is developed to support both Second Life and OpenSim grids. Imports with other import/export capable viewers may or may not work, and are not tested. To import a creation, unzip the archive and chose File > Import to import just the build itself, or File > Import and Upload to import the build and upload the neccessary textures and apply them. Chose the file named after the creation you want to upload on your harddisk and wait until the import is complete. All building, uploading and texturing is done automatically.

The imported build will come with full permissions and state you as the creator and owner. You are free to modify and use them in any way, just keep in mind to state me as the original copyright holder when you give the creations away.
